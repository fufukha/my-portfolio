# My Portfolio 
My personal portfolio [kamile-portfolio.vercel.app](https://kamile-portfolio.vercel.app) is built with the [React](https://reactjs.org/) Framework for Production [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) + [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and hosted by [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). 

Requests to GitHub's GraphQL API are queried using [Apollo Client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/).

It uses [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) for animation and [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/) for styled components and theming.

The mobile design prototype was created using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/). The figma design file is [here](https://github.com/fufukha/my-portfolio/blob/main/demo/portfolio_mock.fig). The instructions on how to import and view Figma files can be found [here](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360041003114-Import-files-into-Figma).
